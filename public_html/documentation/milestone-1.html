            <ul>
                <li><strong>Name:</strong>Glenn Zandig</li>
                <li><strong>Age:</strong>59</li>
                <li><strong>Tech in Use:</strong>Windows desktop computers at work and home. Internet Explorer Browser.  Apple iPhone 12 with unlimited Facebook access.</li>
                <li><strong>Family Status:</strong>Married with adult aged kids and grand children</li>
                <li><strong>Role in Company:</strong>The sole remaining founder and CEO of a large regional pizza chain who is struggling to
                stay relevant in the new age of tech start-up's.  Their pizza is great but their growth has stalled and they need an
                    edge over their competition.</li>
                <li><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors</strong> Glenn is always busy with meetings and other business related issues                 that take up a lot of his time.  He is also a new grandfather and realizes he wants to spend more time with family than                 deal with the day to day stress of being the head executive of his business.  He won't take your call but he will sit                   down and look at his emails even when he is at home. He makes decisions that will impact hundreds of employees and can't                sift through BS all the time.  He prefers emails to phone calls because interactions are more easily searched.</li>
                <li><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Glenn is usually a busy man but the pandemic has brought on a slew of
                    new problems he was not expecting.  He is losing staff and high level executives at a break neck speed and he needs
                    to hire yesterday!  He doesn't know much about websites much less social media, apps and other industry standard technologies.  He usually relied on face-to-face networking events to find his C-level execs
                    but has had a hard time transitioning to the "new normal" of online networking.  He is relying heavily on LinkedIN
                    and personal portfolio websites to pinpoint a solution for his technology needs.
                     </li>
                <li><strong>Goals:</strong>Glenn needs to find an individual that can handle his new technology needs and propel his business into the new digital age or his
                company will get crushed by more nimble food start-ups.  He needs to focus his efforts He needs to hire someone within the next 6 weeks that
                can take some pressure off of him.  He is also open to outsourcing his technology needs but needs a company
                that understands his business.</li>
                <li><strong>User Story:</strong>Glenn needs to find a technology solution in 6 weeks.</li>
